ARTIS README FILE
-----------------

As of 2012-07-30 the code base of ARTIS will be maintained using the
GIT (http://git-scm.com/) distributed version control system. To
access the code checkout the latest snaphsot of the code in a local
working directory by typing

git clone USERNAME@slogin.mpa-garching.mpg.de:/afs/mpa/project/artis/code.git

(This requires ssh access to the MPA machines. There are ways around
this to give e.g. Sharon direct access to the code repository in the
future). Then commit your changes to your local copy of the repo and
push them back to the server once you are satisfied that they
work. 

For an introduction to GIT see http://git-scm.com/book

Modifications of the code should be documented in the commit log
rather than this README file from now on.



This was the old README file which kept track of modifications to the
code until 2012-07-30:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-05-13, v115_omp
 - [NEW] Take into account the deposition of kinetic energy of 56Co 
   positrons. This has been neglected so far but influences the late
   time (bolometric) light curves starting at ~50 days after the 
   explosion. 
 - [NEW] Reintroduced the recording of line statistics, i.e. the total
   number of emissions and absorptions per line. So far this is only 
   well defined for MPI only runs. For hybrid runs the information is 
   taken from thread 0 only. Should be straightforward to generalise,
   but I'm not sure if this is worth the additional computational costs.
   To activate this feature the macro RECORD_LINESTAT needs to be defined
   in sn3d.h
 - [NEW, 2011-06-14] Calculation of bf-opacity can be reduced to levels 
   for which the "relative population" is larger than 1e-6.
 - [NEW, 2012-06-20] Reintroduced a simple grey treatment for the optical
   photons. It interprets the original opacity_case variable from the 
   input.txt file and behaves in the same way. Internally, however, it 
   uses the structure of the initial grey opacity treatment and the concept
   of grey cells rather than the original opacity_case branches.
 - [NEW, 2012-07-30] Communicate information on how much radioactive
   energy was released at a given time and how much of this was
   deposited by gamma-rays and positrons. Write this to new output
   file deposition.out
 - [FIXED, 2011-08-05] Minor change to update_parameterfile ensures 
   that the automatic updating of the input file works on vip too.
 - [FIXED, 2011-08-07] Continuation jobs got stuck if optically thick 
   cells were present at restart. To fix this, gridsave.dat now records
   if a modelgrid cell is optically thick. This ensures that the cell
   is treated in LTE as it should.
 - [FIXED, 2012-01-10] Declaration of get_abundance was missing in 
   calculate_populations. Unclear to which extent this should influence
   the simulations.
 - [FIXED, 2012-01-12] corrphotoionrenorm coefficients were not properly
   derived in update_grid. This will lead to spurious zeros in the 
   renormalisation coefficients during the calculation of the photoionisation
   rate and thus likely tend to supress the ionisation. For a test run with
   W7 the influence was not significant (generally below 0.1 mag, only in 
   I and J band there is an offset of ~0.1 mag at first maximum. However,
   the uncertainties due to our limited standard atomic data set are larger
   in these bands). FOR FUTURE SIMULATIONS IT IS HIGLY RECOMMENDED TO
   USE THIS FIX.
 - [FIXED, 2012-01-19] BlueGene OpenMP bug solved. Only change is that the 
   phixslist initialisation is no longer done in a parallel section but by
   the master thread only which then loops over all thread indices. Maybe
   the compiler optimized the parallel section and thereby screwed up the
   threads somehow? ADDENDUM 2012-01-23: strangely, using a more aggressive
   optimization (specifically O5, instead of the thus far used O3) also
   shows no problem with OpenMP runs, even if the phixslist initialisation
   is done the old way. 
 - [MODIFIED, 2011-09-13] search_groundphixslist: the code does no longer
   abort when a non-groundlevel continuum is at the frequency of the blue
   most groundlevel continuum. This turned out to happen for Mg IV, which
   has a duplicate ground state (levels 0 and 1 have energy zero) in
   the atomic data file. Instead the code now gives a lengthy fatal
   warning statement and prints the level energies of the corresponding
   ion.
 
2011-03-24, v114_omp (MERGE OF v112_omp_rs_pol and v113_omp)
 - [NEW] Polarization treatment: this adds additional information
   to the packets files. Be aware that old versions of exspec and
   analysis scripts will therefore no longer work
 - [MODIFIED] Restart mechanism: it is now possible to divide the
   full simulation to individual job steps by selecting a wall clock
   time. For the moment this is hard coded to 3 hours. To use this
   mode the code must be compiled with the TIMED_RESTARTS flag.

2011-02-16, v113_omp
 - [FIXED] For 3D models with empty cells (e.g. in the edges of the 
   simulation volume) the effective value of npts_model is less
   than ngrid. If this is not accounted for (as it was up to now), 
   a substantial number of tasks (up to 50%) will be idle while doing 
   update_grid! This is now fixed. Note however, that this does not
   have any effect on memory consumption since the related arrays
   are allocated statically with size MMODELGRID+1 at compile time.
 - [MODIFIED] Initial grey approximation. Up to now r-packets have been
   treated grey for a full time step if they started their propagation
   in an optically thick cell. On the other hand packets starting in
   optically thin cells, were even treated non-grey in optically thick
   cells. This was changed now such that a packet's treatment depends
   only on the properties of the cell thorugh which it actually propagates.
   This change was required to make it possible to omitt updating a cell's
   level populations when a packet changes to an optically thick cell.
   During the grey-phase of a simulation this should give a significant
   speed-up of the calculation. At least it was the case for the I0040
   deflagration model in inital tests (2011-02-04).
 - [MODIFIED] sn3d.c now writes a complete snapshot of the current
   grid properties to gridsave.dat (therefore additional MPI 
   communications had to be implemented). This simplifies the restart
   of subsequent job steps largely. At the same time it is taken care
   that input.txt knows about the current job step so that it doesn't
   need to be modified either for restarting (2011-02-04). 
   FOR THAT TO WORK THE FORMAT OF THE INPUT.TXT FILE HAS BEEN CHANGED. 
   INITAL AND FINAL TIME STEPS NOW NEED TO BE GIVEN AS THREE DIGITS: 
   e.g. 000 111

2010-06-09, v112_omp
 - [MODIFIED] Within macroatom.c we now allow for jumps to the
   lowest energy level of a given species, if this is not the
   species' absolute ground level (i.e. the ground state of the
   neutral ion). Technically this means we changed from checking
   for (level == 0) and (ion == 0) to (level == 0) and 
   (get_ionstage(element,ion) == 0). This allows us to use model
   atoms which have an ionized species as the lower boundary.
 - [FIXED] rpkt_emiss and compton_emiss were not properly 
   renormalised in non-MPI runs

2010-04-01, v111_omp
 - [NEW] Makepoint exgamma produces now a binary which extracts
   both the angle-averaged gamma light curve and gamma spectras
   from the escaping packets. No estimators are used (2010-04-01).

2010-03-31, v110_omp
 - [NEW] kpkt interactions take some physical time during which
   they follow the expansion of the ejecta. This was introduced to
   reduce the work imbalance problem (2010-02-19). 
    * A first attempt used an approximative timescale for rad. 
      recombination. This reduced the work imbalance noticeably
      but still there are imbalances on the order of 1h.
      For 40bfcont w7 runs this has no consequence on the
      light curves.
    * Introducing an additional diffusion time for macro-atoms
      changes the light curves drastically.
    * Since tests with w7 have shown, that using a kpkt-diffusion
      time on the order of 0.001 ... 0.01 of the lenght of a time 
      step drastically reduces the work imbalance but has only
      minor implications on the lightcurves this approach has
      been incorporated to the code. It can be controlled by a
      *ADDITIONAL LINE* in input.c which gives the kpkt-diffusion
      time as a fraction of a timestep's length as the first
      parameter (a float) and the number of timesteps for which
      this approxiamtion should be used as the 2nd parameter (an int).
 - [NEW] OpenMP version now also writes grey optical depths
   and ionization fractions to the estimators files. This
   requires one additional float variable on the model grid
   for the grey depth. Cooling and heating rates are still
   not available in estimators.out for OpenMP runs.
 - [FIXED] corrphotoionrenorm and gammaestimators were treated
   as floats instead of doubles while reading in restart files. 
   This caused problems with the 2D deflagration model due to 
   LARGE corrphotoionrenorm values (2010-03-31).
 - [FIXED] Interaction counters now really collect the numbers
   for all OpenMP threads (the limitation of recording them
   only for thread zero has been removed)
 - [FIXED] grid::modelgrid[n].initial_radial_pos was not initialised
   properly for 3D models with empty cells, where modelgrid
   and simulation grid differ. MAKE SURE THAT OTHER MODELGRID
   QUANTITIES ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THE SAME THING. MOST LIKELY
   NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF 3D DEFLAG RUN *THINK*  

2009-10-23, v109_omp
 - mean number of interactions per packet now also counts the 
   number of internal MA-jumps
 - record direction of packets before absorption in bound-bound 
   interactions. *NOTE*: this change causes a modification in the 
   packets files!
 - Keep now two copies of temporary packets files to avoid 
   problems with restarts when the job aborts during update_grid
   For the restart of an odd/even time step the even/odd packets
   files must be copied to the job directory of the continuation  
   run.

2009-10-09, v108_omp
 - OpenMP works now after changing almost all threadprivate
   variables to arrays of sizes MTHREADS (default 4). For more
   OpenMP threads this must be adjusted in types.h.
 - packets are now sorted according to the cell density 
   before update_packets to force packets in denser cells to be
   treated first. Hopefully this reduces the work imbalance
   together with the dynamical OpenMP scheduling.
 - gamma estimator and bf-heating estimator now sample the corrected
   photoionization and bf heating coefficients which take into
   account stimulated recombination
 - grey optical depth to the surface is used now for initial
   grey approximation. the local grey and thomson depths are
   logged in the output files but not in the estimator files.
   Using a different grey approximation requires changes in 
   update_grid.c
 - exspec extracts only angle-averaged spectra and light curves 
   for 1D models

2009-07-15, v108
 - Modified initial grey approximation now calculates
   an optical depth to the surface of the simulation
   volume using kappa_grey.
 - As of now (2009-07-15) the local thomson and grey
   optical depth in a cell and the depth to the
   surface are save in the estimator files. This requires
   a special treatment for restart files and should be
   removed, after a "final" decision on the grey approximation
   was made.

2009-05-14, v107
 - OpenMP parallelisation re-introduced (still not working properly
   as of 2009-06-16).
 - calculate_kpkt_rates (which depend only on grid properties)
   now moved to update grid and communicated via MPI.
 - exspec routines rewritten to save memory. Now informations 
   on last emissions and absorptions are extracted from the packets
   files. 
 - Proper initialisation of absorption counters added (2009-05-30).
 - Changes to the initial grey approximation, reintroducing
   the concept of kappa_grey.
 - Array boundaries which have to be changed for each run moved to 
   types.h

2009-05-06, v106
 - Additionally to the 56Ni decay chain the code is now 
   capable of handling the 52Fe and 48Cr chain. Therefore 
   two additional values must be provided in the model files 
   which five the inital abundances of 52Fe and 48Cr and 
   parameter files for the gamma lines are needed. So far only 
   gammas coming the 48Cr chain are propagated, thus cr48_lines.txt
   and v48_lines.txt are sufficient. 52Fe gammas are deposited
   instantaneously.
   So far there is no concept of initial abundances for the radioactive
   daughter nuclei in this chains (i.e. 52Mn and 48V are initially 0).
 - Formulae for the abundance of the radioactive isotopes have
   been checked.
 - Bug in interpolation of ratecoefficients fixed. So far 
   interpolations at the upper temperature boundary tried to
   access an unallocated array position. Results for this
   case were therefore not defined properly.
   This also caused the 64bit problem on vip!
 - Several minor bugs concerning exspec fixed
 - Proper initialisation of absorption counters added (2009-05-30).

2009-04-19, v105
 - exspec reads packets files only once to speed up extraction
 - exspec extracts los dependent emission information, if 
   selected in input.txt. This needs huge amounts of memory.
   Need to adjust MNUBINS
 - escaping packets carry time of last emission

2009-02-02, v104, several subversions
 - avoid use of my_malloc. malloc is faster and allows the same
   mode of operation on all machines. this became possible on vip
   in 32bit. there is still a problem in 64bit.
 - spectrum extraction problem solved, but removed into a separate
   make target exspec to reduce memory consumption of MC run

2009-01-14, v103
 - bf-cooling adjusted to match the change in the ionisation formula
 - initial grey approximation now paramterisable via input.txt
 - number of initial LTE steps for a NLTE run now in input.txt
 - number of bf-continua to take into account for propagation now
   in input.txt. For thermal balance and ionisation balance
   all continua are taken into account. 
 - write out of all grid related data to one estimator file per MPI task 
 - still a problem: spectra extraction at the end of the
   simulation


2008-12-16, changes
 - initial grey approximation for cells which are Compton optical thick
 - store again all rate coefficients, even if we use only TAKE_N_BFCONTINUA
   continua for propagation. This allows us to solve the ionisation
   balance "correctly"
 - change to the ionisation equation from 
     n_0,j,k*Gamma_j,k = nne*n_0,j+1,k*Alpha_j,k
   to
     n_0,j,k*Gamma_j,k = nne*N_j+1,k*Alpha_j,k


v102 same as 

 multielements_v101_p_modelgrid_ionisinglevels_iterate_ion

capable to read in 2D and 3D models again (not tested)
